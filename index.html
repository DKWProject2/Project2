  <p class="marg">Welcome to all, and thank you for stopping by to look over
     my wares. I have been doing fancy-work on-and-off for
     over fifty-five years, ever since I was initially taught it by an
     old sailor who lived quite close to me. I used the know-ledge
     through my Navy days and have now taken it up again
     as a full-time business.
  </p> 
  <p>I make belts, lanyards, wheel-coverings, tiller-wraps, hand-rail wraps, bellropes
     of varying complexity, instrument straps, camera straps, luggage slings...
     if you can do it with a piece of line, I've probably either made it or seen it.  I
     can do MacNamara's lace and mast skirts, but they tend to get very
     expensive due to the great amount of time involved.

  <p><a href="http://www.frayedknotarts.com/needlecase.html">Scrimshaw</a> is made in the traditional method using needles and graphite
     <em>(for lampblack is not something one can find about the house these days)</em>
     and is usually done on bamboo or bone for needlecases, although I will
     attempt other materials on pre-paid order. As I make
     more of this it will eventually migrate to it's own page(s), provided my
     hands hold up!

  <p><a href="http://www.frayedknotarts.com/belts.html">Belts</a> are "made-to-length" (although I do keep some standard-length
     belts on hand) and vary from simple squareknots throughout, to
     ten-diamond designs, open and filled diamonds, chevrons and crosses,
     etc., etc. Prices run from $120.00  for a small plain belt up through the
     roof for specialty items. I also can make suspenders (galluses), one
     example of which is shown on the <a href="http://www.frayedknotarts.com/knots/knotpics.html">knotpics</a> page.

  <p><a href="http://www.frayedknotarts.com/wheel.html">Wheels</a> are coxcombed along the rim of the wheel
     (aesthetically, I prefer to leave the spokes un-flemished
     as it produces a 'floating' effect on the rim fancywork,
     but if you wish, I can also do work on them as well) and
     can either be done at my location (if you ship me a wheel
     to work on) or I can travel to your location to do the work.

  <p>I also do stair rails, companionways, or anything that's round and
     needs flemishing. It's quite pricey but for those who love the
     look, a definite plus for their vessel or home/workplace.
     This is a picture of me after doing three flights of stairs for
     The Joint Strike Fighter people in Maryland.

  <p>Well, since you are, let me switch hats to my non-commercial one and talk a bit about the <a href="http://www.frayedknotarts.com/library.html">Library</a> section of the site.</p>
  <p>In there you will find pictures of fancywork and other nautical-type items (mostly handmade) which occupied the time of a great
     many sailor-men during the age of sail.  When you were on a whale-ship and looking at four years before you returned to your
     home port, and sometimes six months between landfalls, it was next to impossible to stay occupied and sane, especially when you
     consider that a whaler carried more men than were necessary to just work the ship, so most men either did scrimshaw with scraps
     of whalebone from their harvests or, more rarely, fancy knotwork. Admittedly, I tend toward the knotwork. Go visit.</p>
  <p>There are also pages on Tutorials on making ropework,  pages devoted to just one knottyer's work, pages for knottyers who have
     gone on to Fiddler's Green and so forth... it's an interesting place I've got here and you'll never know just what you may find in the orlop!
