  <p class="marg">Welcome to all, and thank you for stopping by to look over
     my wares.  I have been doing fancy-work on-and-off for
     over fifty-five years, ever since I was initially taught it by an
     old sailor who lived quite close to me.  I used the know-ledge
     through my Navy days and have now taken it up again
     as a full-time business.
  </p> 
  <p>I make belts, lanyards, wheel-coverings, tiller-wraps, hand-rail wraps, bellropes
     of varying complexity, instrument straps, camera straps,  luggage slings....
     if you can do it with a piece of  line, I've probably either made it or seen it.  I
     can do MacNamara's lace and mast skirts, but  they tend to get verrrry
     expensive due to the great amount of time involved.
  </p>

  <p><a href="http://www.frayedknotarts.com/needlecase.html">Scrimshaw</a> is made in the traditional method using needles and graphite
     <em>(for lampblack is not something one can find about the house these days)</em>
     and is usually done on bamboo or bone for needlecases, although I will
     attempt other materials on pre-paid order. As I make
     more of this it will eventually migrate to it's own page(s), provided my
     hands hold up!

  <p><a href="http://www.frayedknotarts.com/belts.html">Belts</a> are "made-to-length" (although I do keep some standard-length
     belts on hand) and vary from simple squareknots throughout, to
     ten-diamond designs, open and filled diamonds, chevrons and crosses,
     etc., etc. Prices run from $120.00  for a small plain belt up through the
     roof for specialty items. I also can make suspenders (galluses), one
     example of which is shown on the <a href="http://www.frayedknotarts.com/knots/knotpics.html">knotpics</a> page.

  <p><a href="http://www.frayedknotarts.com/wheel.html">Wheels</a> are coxcombed along the rim of the wheel
     (aesthetically, I prefer to leave the spokes un-flemished
     as it produces a 'floating' effect on the rim fancywork,
     but if you wish, I can also do work on them as well) and
     can either be done at my location (if you ship me a wheel
     to work on) or I can travel to your location to do the work.
